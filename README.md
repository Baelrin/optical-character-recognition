# Optical Character Recognition

This project uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images. It's built using Python and leverages the EasyOCR library for text detection and extraction.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- EasyOCR

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch easyocr
```

### Running the Project

To run the project, navigate to the project directory and execute the `master.py` script:

```bash
python master.py
```

This will check if there's any text present in the image located at 'images/1.png'.

## Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The programming language used
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - The deep learning framework used
- [EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR) - The OCR library used
